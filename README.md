ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m Theo ZuÃ±iga, a Systems Engineer, Frontend Developer, and MBA graduate specializing in Business Intelligence and Big Data. I thrive at the intersection of technology and data, creating solutions that are not only efficient but also data-driven.

ðŸ’» My tech stack includes: Python, SQL, JavaScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Django, MySQL, and Git. Iâ€™m experienced with data analysis tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Looker, and I am familiar with project management methodologies like SCRUM and Agile. As a front-end developer, I focus on creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces with a big sense of UX/UI.

ðŸ“Š With a strong background in Business Intelligence, I leverage data to drive business strategies, optimize processes, and improve decision-making. I enjoy blending technical expertise with strategic insights to deliver impactful results.

ðŸŒ± In my spare time, I like all kinds of sports, sculpture, modeling, painting, and teaching.

Feel free to browse my projects, and letâ€™s connect to explore exciting opportunities together!
